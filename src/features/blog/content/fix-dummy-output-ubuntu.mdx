# How to Fix "Dummy Output" Audio on Ubuntu

The "Dummy Output" issue means Ubuntu cannot detect your sound card. Follow these steps in order until the problem is resolved.

---

<Steps>

<Step title="Restart PulseAudio or PipeWire">

**Ubuntu 22.04 and later (PipeWire):**

```bash
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

**Ubuntu 20.04 and earlier (PulseAudio):**

```bash
pulseaudio --kill
pulseaudio --start
```

> **Tip:** Check your audio after this step. If it works, you're done!

</Step>

<Step title="Reload ALSA">

ALSA is the low-level audio layer. Reloading it can resolve detection issues.

```bash
sudo alsa force-reload
```

Then reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

</Step>

<Step title="Check if Your Sound Card is Detected">

Run the following to list all detected sound cards:

```bash
aplay -l
```

- ✅ **Card is listed** — the issue is with PulseAudio/PipeWire (continue to Step 4)
- ❌ **No soundcards found** — it's a driver or hardware issue (skip to Step 6)

</Step>

<Step title="Unmute Channels in ALSA Mixer">

Your audio channels might be muted at the ALSA level.

```bash
alsamixer
```

- Use **left/right arrow keys** to navigate channels
- Press **M** to unmute any channel showing `MM` at the bottom
- Press **F6** to select a different sound card if needed
- Press **Esc** to exit

Then save the settings:

```bash
sudo alsactl store
```

</Step>

<Step title="Reinstall Audio Packages">

**For PipeWire (Ubuntu 22.04+):**

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire pipewire-pulse
```

**For PulseAudio (Ubuntu 20.04 and earlier):**

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
sudo apt install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
sudo reboot
```

**Also reinstall ALSA base packages:**

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall alsa-base alsa-utils
sudo alsa force-reload
```

</Step>

<Step title="Fix Missing or Broken Audio Drivers">

If your sound card wasn't detected in Step 3, you likely have a driver issue.

**Install recommended drivers automatically:**

```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo reboot
```

**Or update your kernel (which includes newer drivers):**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

</Step>

<Step title="Check Hardware with lspci / lsusb">

Verify your audio hardware is visible to the system at all.

**For built-in/PCIe audio:**

```bash
lspci | grep -i audio
```

**For USB audio devices:**

```bash
lsusb
```

> **Warning:** If your device doesn't appear here, check that **onboard audio is enabled** in your BIOS/UEFI settings.

</Step>

<Step title="Check BIOS Settings">

If all software steps fail:

1. Restart your PC and enter BIOS/UEFI (usually **Del**, **F2**, or **F10** on boot)
2. Navigate to **Advanced** or **Onboard Devices** settings
3. Make sure **HD Audio** or **Onboard Audio** is set to **Enabled**
4. Save and exit

</Step>

</Steps>

## Still Not Working?

Check your system logs for audio-related errors:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i audio
journalctl --user -u pipewire --since "1 hour ago"
```

You can also post the output of these commands to the [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org) or [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com) for community help.
